              My Dearest, <br /> <br /> On this day may 1, surrounded by the
              beauty and joy you bring into the world. From the moment our paths
              crossed, you've ignited a spark within me that refuses to dim.
              Your laughter is music to my ears, your smile flutters my heart and your presence fills my days
              with light and warmth. I find myself drawn to you in ways I can't
              fully explain, but with every beat of my heart, I know it's true.
             day by day I long for the chance to explore the magic of our
              connection. On this day of may, i promise to love you forever and always. This year you'll be celebrated and you'll stand before Kings and nation shall bow for you.
              Àsùnkẹ́ may all your wishes comes true, I love you more than you can imagine 🫶💝<br /> <br /> Yours truly
              <br /> <br /> Tèmítáyọ̀.
